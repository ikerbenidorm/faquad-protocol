# FAQUAD Protocol Numerical Solutions

## Project Description

This repository contains code for numerically solving the FAQUAD protocol, with examples for both Two-Level Systems (TLS) and multi-level systems. For TLS, an analytical solution is also included to compute the error between analytical and numerical results. The project utilizes both Julia and Python kernels.

## Contents

- **Two-Level Systems (TLS):** Includes numerical and analytical solutions.
- **Multi-Level Systems:** Numerical solutions for systems with more than two levels.
- **Julia and Python Kernels:** Codes are available in both Julia and Python.

## Usage

Please refer to the specific examples in the repository to understand how to execute the codes using either Julia or Python kernels.
